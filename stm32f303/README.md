# stm32f303
I used [this](https://github.com/seeers/CAN-Bus-Arduino_Core_STM32) as a reference.

# Support board
- STM32F303xB/C/D/E
- STM32F303x6/8
- STM32F328x8,
- STM32F358xC
- STM32F398xE 

# Changes from the original

- frame format   
The original support only Base frame format: with 11 identifier bits.   
This example support Extended frame format: with 29 identifier bits.   

- CAN port   
The original uses PB8 and PB9 as CAN ports.   
In this example, you can select the CAN port.   

# Remap CAN port

CAN_RX mapped to PA11, CAN_TX mapped to PA12   
```
CANInit(CAN_1000KBPS, 0);  // CAN_RX mapped to PA11, CAN_TX mapped to PA12
```

CAN_RX mapped to PB8, CAN_TX mapped to PB9 (not available on 36-pin package)   
```
CANInit(CAN_1000KBPS, 2);  // CAN_RX mapped to PB8, CAN_TX mapped to PB9
```

CAN_RX mapped to PD0, CAN_TX mapped to PD1 (available on 100-pin and 144-pin package)   
```
CANInit(CAN_1000KBPS, 3);  // CAN_RX mapped to PD0, CAN_TX mapped to PD1
```
